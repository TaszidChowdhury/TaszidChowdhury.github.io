# Who Am I?

<img src="assets/images/ThisIsMe.jpg" alt="Taszid Chowdhury"/>

Hello! My name is Taszid Chowdhury, and I am passionate about technology, cybersecurity, and using computer science to solve real-world problems. I thrive on building meaningful projects, exploring new tools, and continuously learning in this ever-evolving tech landscape.

## Background

I grew up in Atlantic City NJ, where I developed a love for exploring how things work—from tinkering with gadgets to diving into code. Over the years, I have honed my skills in Python, Java, cybersecurity fundamentals, and cloud infrastructure, which has led me to pursue a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Stockton University. I’ve worked on various academic and personal projects, including setting up a secure VPC on AWS and collaborating on a penetration testing report. 

## Interests

When I'm not working, I enjoy traveling, going to the gym, boxing, and coding mods for games like Minecraft, Skyrim, and Stardew Valley. I find it fascinating how vibrant communities can come together to enhance games and build entirely new worlds. I’m also a fan of reverse engineering game mechanics just to see how far I can push the limits of what’s possible

## Goals

My goal is to make a positive impact through technology by building secure, user-friendly solutions and helping others along the way. I believe in continuous growth and strive to improve every day as a student, developer, and person.

Thank you for taking the time to learn a little about me. Feel free to connect with me if you'd like to collaborate or share ideas!
